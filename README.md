# css-zengarden

Hi there! I am a developer / designer from Houston and this is my version of [css zen garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) utilizing just sass.

The CSS Zen Garden is a World Wide Web development resource. The goal of the site is to showcase what is possible with CSS-based design. Style sheets contributed by graphic designers from around the world are used to change the visual presentation of a single HTML file, producing hundreds of different designs. Aside from reference to an external CSS file, the HTML markup itself never changes. All visual differences are the result of the CSS (and supporting imagery).
